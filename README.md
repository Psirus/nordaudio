Nordaudio
=========

![](https://github.com/Psirus/nordaudio/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)

A small wrapper around [PortAudio](https://github.com/PortAudio/portaudio) for
cross-platform audio IO.

Very much *WIP*, but you can check the `example/sine_low_level.nim` for the
sine output example from PortAudio translated into Nim.

Of course, you need to have PortAudio installed, under Debian/Ubuntu:

    sudo apt install portaudio19-dev
